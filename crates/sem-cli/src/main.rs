        caller/callee relations locally — relations are the slow part on cold/large repos, and the \
        upload should never wait on them. What happens next depends on the server's response:\n\
        \x20 - it queued its own relations enrichment: sem prints a one-line note and exits, no local \
        graph work at all;\n\
        \x20 - it can't compute them for this repo (private/unregistered — the consent boundary), or \
        it's an older server that doesn't know about this flow yet: sem runs the same budgeted local \
        relations pass as before and attaches the result afterward, printing what happened either way.\n\
        \x20 The budget is adaptive to repo size by default: 90s up to ~10k tracked files, ramping \
        linearly to an 8min cap at ~100k+ tracked files (tracked-file count read from the git index, \
        no repo walk). Set SEM_RELATIONS_BUDGET_MS to override with an exact value in milliseconds — \
        it always wins over the adaptive curve.\n\
        Set SEM_RELATIONS_LOCAL=1 to always compute relations locally before uploading (the old, \
        single-upload behavior), instead of the above. With cloud consent off, none of this runs: no \
        network, no relations upload, identical to running with no cloud account at all.")]
