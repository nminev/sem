///   `variable_declaration` (the *name*, confusingly — not to be conflated
///   with TS/JS's `variable_declaration`) — same shape, same reason.
/// - `method_definition` (TS/JS): a plain method, a getter (`get foo()`), a
///   setter (`set foo(v)`), a static method (`static foo()`), and an async
///   method (`async foo()`) are all `method_definition` nodes whose

///   — found via `kappa_stats` on the TypeScript-monster corpus merging
///   `foo() {}` and `get foo() {}` under one kappa (KAPPA.md v1.1's
///   collision analysis).
/// - `public_field_definition` (TS): `readonly x = 1`/`abstract x: T`/
///   `x = 1` are all `public_field_definition` nodes — same shape as the
///   `method_definition` case, found the same way.
/// - `method_signature` (TS): the interface/ambient-context sibling of

///   `interface`, same shape.
/// - `property_signature` (TS): `public_field_definition`'s interface/

///   the `public_field_definition` fix alone).
/// - `function_declaration`, `function_expression`, `generator_function`,
///   `generator_function_declaration`, `arrow_function` (TS/JS): each has
///   an `async` keyword as an anonymous non-sole child when present
///   (`async function f() {}` vs `function f() {}`, `async () => {}` vs

///   {}` under one kappa on the TS-monster corpus, which is what triggered
///   checking every other "keyword modifies a callable" node kind in the
///   grammar, not just the one the first sample happened to show.
/// - `export_statement` (TS/JS): `export default Foo;`, `export as
///   namespace Foo;`, and `export = foo;` are all `export_statement`
///   nodes whose `default`/`as`+`namespace`/`=` tokens are anonymous

///   as namespace Foo;` and `export default Foo;` under one kappa.
/// - `function_definition` (Python): the exact same `async` shape as TS/JS
///   above, in a completely different grammar — `async def f():` and `def
///   f():` are both `function_definition` nodes. This one wasn't found on

///   kappa in `tests/signals/tests.py`. The original per-language sweep
///   (KAPPA.md v1.1 §2) checked Python's `global`/`nonlocal` and missed
///   `async def` entirely; running the corpus analysis against a Python
///   repo, not just TypeScript ones, is what caught it.
///
/// This entire cluster (every table entry after `property_declaration`)
/// was found by the SAME "kappa_stats on a real corpus, sample collision
/// groups, eyeball, check the parse tree" loop, applied repeatedly across
/// languages until the sample stopped turning up new node kinds — not from

/// Decide whether a leaf token is semantically meaningful enough for kappa.
/// Precise spec (also documented in `KAPPA.md`, which a reimplementation
/// against a different parser should follow instead of this tree-sitter-
/// specific code):
///
/// 1. Named leaves (tree-sitter's `is_named()`) are always included --
///    these are identifiers, literals, and similar grammar productions: the
///    tokens a typed AST exposes as node fields (`Identifier.name`,
///    `Literal.value`, ...).
/// 2. Anonymous leaves that are pure punctuation/delimiters
///    (`KAPPA_PUNCTUATION`) are always excluded.
/// 3. Anonymous leaves whose text is entirely ASCII alphanumeric/underscore
///    look like keywords (`function`, `class`, `return`, `if`, ...) and are
///    excluded, UNLESS either:
///    (3a) the leaf is the *leading discriminator* of a
///    `KAPPA_LEADING_KEYWORD_DISCRIMINATOR_PARENTS` parent (v1.1) — e.g.
///    TS/JS `let`/`const` in a `lexical_declaration`; or
///    (3b) the leaf's parent is a "pure keyword bag" (v1.1, generalizing
///    v1's "sole child of a named parent" rule) — every child of the
///    parent is itself an anonymous keyword-shaped leaf, so the keyword(s)
///    are the node's entire semantic payload and the parent's node-kind
///    alone can't tell them apart. Covers both a single bare-word choice
///    (tree-sitter-typescript's `predefined_type: $ => choice('any',
///    'boolean', 'string', ...)`, `accessibility_modifier: $ =>
///    choice('public', 'private', 'protected')`) and a flat list of several
///    (tree-sitter-java's `modifiers: $ => repeat1(choice('public',
///    'private', 'final', 'static', ...))`).
/// 4. Everything else anonymous is a symbolic operator/punctuator that DOES
///    carry meaning (`+`, `==`, `=>`, `...`, `:`, `?`, `.`, ...) and is
///    included.
///
/// `known_parent` is `node`'s parent, already known by the caller's
/// traversal -- see `structural_and_semantic_hash`'s doc comment for why this
/// must not fall back to calling `Node::parent()` itself.
