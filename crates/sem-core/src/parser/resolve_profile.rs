//! Opt-in, behavior-neutral instrumentation for pass-2 (resolution) of
//! `EntityGraph::build`, gated by the `SEM_PROFILE_RESOLVE=1` environment
//! variable.
//!
//! Every public function here is a cheap no-op (a single `enabled()` check,
//! itself a cached env-var read) unless the variable is set, and nothing in
//! this module changes resolution output — it only observes timings and
//! candidate-list sizes at points the resolver already visits. Built to
//! settle semx-022 step 1: see `crates/sem-core/RESOLUTION-PROFILE.md`.
//!
//! Design notes:
//! - Phase-level timers (reparse, pass-1 scan, scope build, ref collection,
//!   the ref-resolution loop, `resolve_ref` itself) are plain `AtomicU64`
//!   nanosecond accumulators, summed across every `resolve_with_scopes_full`
//!   call (one per 5,000-file chunk on repos over `PARSED_FILE_REUSE_LIMIT`,
//!   one call otherwise) so the numbers cover a whole build.
//! - Per-name candidate-lookup stats (`class_members`/`symbol_table` bucket
//!   sizes actually hit during resolution, and how long disambiguation over
//!   them took) are accumulated *locally per file* with zero locking on the
//!   hot path, then merged into a global map with one short lock per file —
//!   not per reference — to keep contention off the timed critical section.
