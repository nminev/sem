//! A long-lived graph build session: cold once, then warm rebuilds that redo
//! work only for changed files and their blast radius (semx-022).
//!
//! # Why a session and not a free function
//!
//! Everything a warm rebuild reuses is *derived state*: per-file entities,
//! per-file scope facts, per-file edges, and the fingerprints that say whether
//! reusing them is still legal. Something has to own that between requests. The
//! sem-cloud server and the MCP server both hold one process across many
//! requests, so an in-process session is the right home for the in-memory
//! case. For a *fresh* process — a `sem` CLI invocation, which does not live
//! across requests — [`GraphSession::export_persisted`] and
//! [`GraphSession::warm_start`] are the disk-crossing pair
//! `crate::parser::facts_store::FactsStore` sits behind (semx-9en):
//! [`FileFacts`], `PrecomputedFileFacts`, and `CachedFileResolution` are all
//! `serde`-serializable for exactly this. [`GraphSession::export_facts`]
//! remains the narrower, entities-only export.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! A warm rebuild produces a graph **bit-identical** to a cold build of the same
//! file contents. That is not a hope the tests check; it is structural. There is
//! one build implementation ([`EntityGraph::build_incremental_core`]), a warm
//! rebuild runs every stage of it in the same order, and reuse happens *inside*
//! the two per-file resolution closures — so every merge, dedupe, sort and index
//! downstream sees exactly the input a cold build would have handed it. The
//! oracle tests exist to catch a mistake in the invalidation rule, not to
//! establish the equality in the first place.
//!
//! # What is conservative here
//!
//! * Only files whose detected language is JS/TS, Python, Go, or Rust may reuse
//!   resolution results (semx-kzy extended this past JS/TS-only, semx-022's
//!   original scope). Every other language is held permanently RED: slower,
//!   never wrong. See [`crate::parser::import_resolution::is_reuse_eligible_file`]
//!   and RESOLUTION-PROFILE.md's "Universal GREEN eligibility" section for the
//!   full per-language verdict and why each remaining language stayed
//!   conservative.
//! * A change to the *file list* (an add or a delete) disables reuse entirely on
//!   corpora large enough to resolve in chunks, because chunk membership — and
//!   therefore the chunk-scoped return-type and instance-attribute maps every
//!   file resolves against — shifts underneath every file after the insertion
//!   point. Smaller corpora resolve in one pass and take adds and deletes
//!   incrementally.
//! * Every file the caller names in `changed_paths` is RED whether or not its
//!   bytes actually differ.

    // directly. Neither kind was recognized, so bash/fish calls were never
    // collected as `AstRefKind::Call` at all -- not a resolution-precision
    // gap, an *extraction* gap: the ref never existed to resolve, cold or
    // warm, in every graph ever built. See RESOLUTION-PROFILE.md's
    // "Universal GREEN eligibility" section, which found and documented
    // this without fixing it (out of that bead's scope); semx-ocj is the
