//! Pluggable, parser-independent fast extractors.
//!
//! # What this is
//!
//! `sem`'s entity extraction is tree-sitter-shaped end to end: a concrete
//! syntax tree (CST) is parsed, then `entity_extractor.rs` walks it with
//! ~3,700 lines of per-grammar node-kind rules. `OXC-FASTPATH.md` measured
//! that a typed-AST parser (oxc) is 20-49x faster than that pipeline on real
//! TypeScript, and then declined to ship it, because the deliverable at the
//! time was *field-identical* output — including `structural_hash`, which is
//! defined by a CST walk and therefore unreachable from an AST by
//! construction.
//!
//! This module is the revival of that idea under a different, weaker, and
//! *sufficient* equivalence: two extractors are equivalent iff they produce
//! the same **user-visible review** — the same entity set (by kappa, name,
//! kind and span) and the same rendered `sem diff`. That equivalence is
//! decided empirically, per candidate extractor, by
//! [`crate::parser::diff_oracle`], which is the shipping gate. Nothing in
//! this module claims equivalence; it only provides the seam an extractor
//! plugs into and the identity that keeps two extractor generations from
//! contaminating each other's caches.
//!
//! # The contract
//!
//! A [`FastExtractor`] is asked for one file's entities, given only
//! `(file_path, content)` — the same inputs
//! [`SemanticParserPlugin::extract_entities`](crate::parser::plugin::SemanticParserPlugin::extract_entities)
//! gets, and the same inputs the parse cache content-addresses. It returns
//! `None` to decline, which is a **silent, safe fallback** to the
//! tree-sitter path: an unsupported construct, a parse error, or a syntax
//! dialect the extractor does not model is never an error, it is a decline.
//!
//! Entities it returns must be complete `SemanticEntity` values — the
//! downstream facts layer, the differ and the caches all read every field.
//! In particular `structural_hash` is load-bearing in two places the differ
//! depends on (`model/identity.rs`: the phase-2 fallback match, which
//! requires it to be *rename-insensitive*, and the `structuralChange`
//! cosmetic verdict), so an extractor that cannot produce a rename-insensitive
//! structural signal will diverge — and the oracle will say so.
//!
//! # Where the seam is, and where it deliberately is not
//!
//! The dispatch sits in
//! [`CodeParserPlugin::extract_entities`](crate::parser::plugins::code::CodeParserPlugin),
//! i.e. behind the *entities-only* extraction API. It deliberately does
//! **not** sit behind `extract_entities_with_tree`, whose callers (pass 1 of
//! `EntityGraph::build`, for both the `retain_parsed_files` arm and the JS/TS
//! `precompute_js_ts_file_facts` arm) need the `tree_sitter::Tree` itself,
//! not just the entities. A fast extractor has no tree to give them; routing
//! those callers through it would silently turn a tree-bearing call into a
//! treeless one and cost pass 2 a serial re-parse. Which callers can and
//! cannot be served is an integration question, answered per call site, with
//! the oracle as the arbiter — not a property of this trait.
//!
//! # Identity, and why it is not optional
//!
//! Every extractor carries a stable [`FastExtractor::identity`] string that
//! **must** change whenever its observable output can. That string is folded
//! into:
//!
//! * the in-process/on-disk parse cache key ([`crate::parser::cache`]), so a
//!   process that flips the switch mid-run cannot be served the other path's
//!   entities; and
//! * (at integration time) the facts-layer language salt, so a corpus entry
//!   written by one extractor generation can never satisfy a lookup made by
//!   another.
//!
//! `OXC-FASTPATH.md`'s "Cache-key reasoning" section is the argument for
//! this; it is honored here rather than deferred.
