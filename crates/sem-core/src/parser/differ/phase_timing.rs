//! Behavior-neutral, zero-cost-off phase timing for `compute_semantic_diff`'s
//! internal work (semx-cc3, the `sem diff` attribution campaign).
//!
//! `compute_semantic_diff` fans out per-file work across a rayon `par_iter`
//! (see `maybe_par_iter!` in `differ.rs`), so there is no single call stack
//! to wrap in an `Instant`. Instead each phase accumulates its own CPU-time
//! (wall-clock summed *per file*, not per invocation) into a process-global
//! atomic counter. Summed CPU-time across threads can exceed the wall-clock
//! time of the whole `compute_semantic_diff` call when the `parallel`
//! feature is on and multiple cores are busy at once — that's expected and
//! is exactly the signal that tells you how much parallelism is absorbing.
//!
//! Gated by the same `SEM_TIMINGS` convention `sem-cli`'s `timings::Timings`
//! uses, read once into a `OnceLock<bool>` so the steady-state cost when
//! timings are off is a single relaxed atomic-bool load per file per phase —
//! no `Instant::now()` calls happen at all when disabled.
//!
//! `sem-core` has no knowledge of `sem-cli`'s `Timings` type (wrong
//! dependency direction), so this module exposes plain accumulate/read/reset
//! functions; `sem-cli`'s diff command pulls the totals out via
//! [`diff_phase_timings`] after each `compute_semantic_diff` call and feeds
//! them into its own `Timings::record`.
