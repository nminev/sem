//! The text tier: `sem grep <pattern>` — literal and basic-regex search
//! served from `TRIGRAM` postings when the pattern makes that possible.
//! See `QUERY-INDEX.md`'s trigram section for the design rationale, the
//! measured budget outcome, and the `sem`-vs-`rg` benchmark table.
//!
//! Pipeline, matching Google Code Search / zoekt's shape (`QUERY-INDEX.md`
//! §9's prior art):
//!
//! ```text
//! pattern -> required trigram query (DNF: OR of AND-sets, §`derive`)
//!         -> candidate file indices (postings intersection/union, §`candidates`)
//!         -> verify: the real regex matcher, on candidates' CURRENT bytes only
//!         -> rg-compatible file:line:text rows
//! ```
//!
//! The pattern is always compiled as a regex (`regex::bytes::Regex`), same
//! default rg uses without `-F` — a literal pattern is simply a regex with no
//! metacharacters, so there is exactly one code path, not a literal/regex
//! fork. What *is* forked is trigram derivation: patterns whose required
//! trigrams can't be established (see `CandidateOrigin`) fall back to
//! `FullScan`, an honest rg-equivalent worst case, never an incorrect answer.
//!
//! **Freshness.** `verify` reads each candidate file's bytes fresh from disk
//! on every call — there is no cached content anywhere in this module, so a
//! *matched* line is always current by construction ("text freshness is
//! simpler than entity freshness: just scan the current bytes", the bead's
//! own framing).
//!
//! **Membership** (semx-ykf): `search` runs `complete::complete_check`
//! concurrently with trigram candidate derivation (`rayon::join`) — the same
//! parallel-stat sweep `commands::query`'s verbs use. A brand-new file joins
//! the candidate set unconditionally (there is no trigram data for it yet,
//! so it cannot be prefiltered — it goes straight to `verify`, same as any
//! `Stopped`-trigram candidate); a deleted file is dropped from the
//! candidate set before `verify` wastes a read on it. This closes the direct
//! analogue of §2's membership gap for the text tier. What is **still** out
//! of scope, and unclosed by this bead: a file *edited* since the index was
//! built such that it newly contains a required trigram it didn't contain
//! before is not discovered by the membership sweep (its mtime changed, but
//! it isn't new or deleted, so neither `FILES`-existence nor
//! `DIRS`-membership catches it) — postings for an existing, modified file
//! are only as fresh as the last `write_query_index`. Detecting *content*
//! drift on every already-known file would mean stat-ing (or re-deriving
//! trigrams for) the whole corpus per query, which is exactly the
//! corpus-proportional cost §1 spent 85% of the query budget removing — so
//! this module still does not attempt that half, and says so here rather
//! than silently.
