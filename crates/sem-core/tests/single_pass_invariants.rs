//! Invariant witnesses for the single-pass columnar build (semx-3tb / W1).
//!
//! These are **invariant tests, not example tests**: each one states an
//! equation from `SINGLE-PASS.md` and samples it over generated inputs. The
//! unfused side of every equation is real production code kept alive as the
//! specification, so a test cannot degrade into "the new code agrees with
//! itself".
//!
//! Generation is a small deterministic LCG rather than a proptest/quickcheck
//! dependency — this crate has neither, and adding one to assert two dozen
//! sampled equalities would be a new noun buying nothing the loop below does
//! not already buy (`benches/common` already generates its fixtures this way
//! for the same reason). Each invariant states its NON-VACUITY probe (the
//! sampled space really contains the interesting case) and its POSITIVE
//! CONTROL (an input class on which the equation is *known* to have a
//! non-trivial answer, so a broken implementation cannot pass by returning a
//! constant).
