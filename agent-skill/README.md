# @ataraxy-labs/sem-skill

One-command setup of [sem](https://github.com/Ataraxy-Labs/sem) (entity-level
code intelligence) for coding agents.

```bash
npx @ataraxy-labs/sem-skill
```

This:

1. Installs the **sem skill** into `~/.claude/skills/sem/` so the agent knows
   when and how to reach for sem (impact, context, diff, blame, log)
   instead of grep for structural code questions.
2. Registers the **sem MCP server** (`sem mcp`) at user scope, so the
   `sem_impact` / `sem_context` / `sem_entities` / ... tools are available in
   every session.

### Optional: a live sem badge in your statusline

```bash
npx @ataraxy-labs/sem-skill --badge
```

Adds a live badge to your Claude Code statusline. The moment your agent
triggers sem you see an animated spinner with the entity being analyzed
(`⊕ sem ⠹ impact validateToken…`), flipping to the result and running savings
when it completes. It shows in real time: how many structural queries this session, the last command **and the
entity it analyzed**, its latency, a sparkline of recent latencies, and a
rotating stat (distinct entities analyzed, top command)
(`⊕ sem ×12  impact validateToken 9ms  ▁▂▃▅▂  · 7 entities analyzed`). It picks
up sem whether the agent uses the MCP tools or the `sem` CLI, and falls back to
recent activity so it never gets stuck on "idle". It is opt-in and
non-destructive: it backs up your settings, and if you already have a statusline
it leaves it untouched and just tells you how to add the badge yourself. To
remove it, delete the `statusLine` key and the `mcp__sem__.*` and `Bash`
PostToolUse entries from `~/.claude/settings.json`.

Everything renders inside the session: sem MCP calls show as proper tool
widgets with compact entity trees, and the statusline badge tracks live
time/token savings. No extra processes needed. Optionally, for a dedicated
terminal pane, the install also drops `~/.claude/sem-live.py`:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/sem-live.py
```

It redraws an ASCII blast-radius graph every time sem runs (the analyzed entity,
its direct callers, transitive count), plus a **savings meter** — a running,
honestly-estimated tally of the grep+read round-trips, time, and tokens sem
saved you this session, and a lifetime counter that grows across sessions. The
estimates are anchored to a measured benchmark and labelled `≈`.

### Optional: the sem guard (always sem, never grep/read/sed on code)

```bash
npx @ataraxy-labs/sem-skill --guard
```

The skill makes sem the agent's *preference*; the guard makes it the *rule*.
It installs a PreToolUse hook that denies grep, file reads, and sed/cat on
code files, with a reason that redirects the agent to the right sem tool
(`sem_context` to read an entity, `sem_entities` with `text=` or `query=` to
search, `sem_impact` for blast radius). The agent can't fall back out of habit.

It is calibrated, not a wall:

- **Pre-edit reads still work**: editors require reading a file first, so the
  second `Read` of the same path always passes.
- **Non-code files** (markdown, JSON, TOML, YAML, ...) are never touched.
- **Pipe filtering is fine**: `cargo test | grep FAILED` passes; `grep -rn foo src/`
  does not.
- Files outside a git repo pass (sem needs git).
- Escape hatch: prefix a command with `SEM_GUARD=0`, or set it in your env to
  disable the guard entirely.

To remove it, delete the `sem-guard.py` PreToolUse entries from
`~/.claude/settings.json`.

It's idempotent, re-run it any time. It needs the sem CLI on PATH
(`npm i -g @ataraxy-labs/sem` or see the
[install docs](https://github.com/Ataraxy-Labs/sem#install)); if sem isn't
installed yet, the skill and MCP registration still go in and work once it is.

Restart the agent session afterward to load the MCP tools.
